How is a 
person’s thought
 deserving to 
be heard?  A
person’s 
understanding 
should be
considered if 
he or she 
accepts criticism. 
He/she has 
listened to 
everything that could
be said about 
them. Also, 
being open 
to what 
could be 
found to 
be fair 
or wrong. 
By receiving
multiple 
opinions of 
a subject 
or matter, 
it 
gives more 
clarification 
to an individual. 
By 
reviewing 
all that can 
be said against 
oneself, 
gives more 
knowledge than 
in any other way.
