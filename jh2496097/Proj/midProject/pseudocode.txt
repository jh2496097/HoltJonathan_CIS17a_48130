PsuedoCode: 
Start program by outputting details of game to user
create of 2D array/pointer table and fill it with 0's 

Start game loop
call a random number for number of blocks that can be created this game currently is 1-6
if 1-6
   create and fill a 2D block dynamically to be played in table

user is promtped with choice of where to place object
user validation input is checked by entering acceptable number for placement
   also checks for multiple columns objects to not cause bounds issues

once user choice has been picked game looks for a non 0 number to place block
   on top of any numbers that could be blocking it from falling all the way down.
After that it will place block vertically where it should go however
if block reaches top row game is ended
else block is set on table accordingly

destroy dynamically created block after it has been placed

Check for all #'s in a row
if all of row == # other than 0 |or| all of row != 0
   create and copy table dynamically with 2D array/pointer
   find row that contains full row of #'s then 
   proceed to copy top of that row down exactly one row to replace
   all the numbers that completed a full row of #'s
   user is awarded 10 points

game ends when a block reaches top row of table

use a structure to save names and points parallel
   Read in names from a file save them
   Read in points from a file save them
if one element > second element
   Sort
Output to screen the highscores
